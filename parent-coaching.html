            <h1>Parent Coaching</h1>
          </div>

          <ul>
            <li>Is your child having difficulty concentrating on tasks at home or at school?</li>
            <li>Does it feel like you have to tell your child the same thing over and over again?</li>
            <li>Are teachers calling you about your child's behavior?</li>
            <li>Does your child seem to have a hard time making and keeping friends?</li>
            <li>Does your child push you away, have tantrums or appear to be filled with rage?</li>
            <li>Do you feel confused and unsure of what to do?</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Children exhibit these types of behaviors for many reasons and trying to figure them out on your own is not always possible. It can be so hard to ask for help, but we all need help from time to time. I know you love your child, but parenting a child with developmental, emotional, mental health or behavioral needs can be very challenging. While working with children and families in mental health agencies, schools and in private practice I have learned that every child has the potential to succeed and that with help, parents are their best advocates. Let me help you help your child be the best he or she can be.</p>
