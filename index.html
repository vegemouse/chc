          <h2>You deserve safe and nurturing relationships</h2>
          <p>The foundation of my therapy is the connection I make with my clients, providing a safe and supportive environment allowing each person to heal and grow.</p>

          <h4>I believe in helping each person find their inner greatness.</h4>

          <p>My individual, couples and family therapy is strength based, attachment focused and individualized. I specialize in working with <span class="highlight">adopted, kinship and blended families</span>. I have extensive experience working with <span class="highlight">LGBTQ individuals, couples and families</span>.</p>

          <h4>Partnering with you in your treatment</h4>

          <p>As a Marriage and Family Therapist, I work with individuals, couples and families within the context of relationships. I utilize a family systems approach based on creating safety and emotional resiliency. I work with my clients to develop treatment plans that build on their unique strengths, and incorporate their religious, spiritual, cultural and ethnic backgrounds and beliefs.</p>

          <p>I am direct and interactive and will work with you to develop clear goals that are results oriented. I utilize treatment approaches that incorporate various evidenced informed and evidenced based treatments depending on the individualized needs of the client(s) I am working with.</p>

          <h4>Let me help you Create Healing Connections with those you love!</h4>
